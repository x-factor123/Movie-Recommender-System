# Project: Movie Recommender System Using Machine Learning!

In today's incredibly busy environment, recommendation systems are becoming more and more crucial. Due to the numerous duties that need to be completed in the 24 hours available, people are constantly pressed for time. As a result, the recommendation systems are crucial since they enable people to make the best decisions without using up their cognitive resources.

A recommendation system basically seeks out content that a particular person might find interesting. Additionally, it takes into account a variety of variables to develop tailored lists of fascinating and helpful information that are unique to each user. Artificial intelligence-based algorithms used in recommendation systems scan through all available options to compile a unique list of options that are interesting and pertinent to a particular user. These outcomes are determined by the user's profile, search and browsing history, what other people with comparable characteristics and demographics are watching, and your likelihood of seeing those films. Using the data at hand, this is accomplished using predictive modelling and heuristics.

### About this project:
